# Libby-Code-Repository
The code presented is from the projects I have worked on as a contirbution to my studies. The water wuality project was the largest project I have worked on to date, having helped in building an XGBoost model after completing extensive EDA on a very large data set containing almost 20 million rows. The project endeavored to generate a predictive model that could be used as a planning tool for local councils to predict the impact changing land composition and usage may have on water quality in the area. 

My coding experience extends beyond the scope shown in this repository in the form of tutorials and lessons however the code I have to show for this is unstructured and confusing without context so I did not include it. The further experience I have relates to Convolution Neural Networks(CNN), more dimensionality reduction techiques such as Isomapping, MDS, Dual PCA etc, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

Please note I have not yet started my final year dissertation/ individual project, this is to be completed over summer however I will be delving into computer vision and exploring pedestrian recognition algorithms in autonomous vehicles which will inevitably strengthen my understanding of HCI and computer vision technology.
